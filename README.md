www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/pubs/Ellis07-beattrack.pdf

The AudioProcessor/processor.py script can be run by running the AudioProcessor/SoundLoader.py script. This script uses the local microphone to stream audio, the audio is then analysed, with the bpm and pitch being extracted. To stop Recording press the spacebar.
